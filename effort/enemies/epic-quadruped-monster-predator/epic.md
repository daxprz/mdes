# Quadruped Monster — Procedurally Animated Predator

## Problem Statement

_(What problem are we solving? Why now? What's the impact of not
solving it? One paragraph — this drives the rest of the epic.)_

## Goals

- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_
- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- _(Explicitly excluded.)_
- _(Future work — deferred to a later epic, ideally linked.)_

## Context

**Source:** _(Where did this come from? Prior epic, user request, bug
report, AID directive — name it explicitly.)_

**Dependencies:**

- _(What must be true before we can start?)_
- _(External systems or features we need.)_

## Stories

| # | XID | Story | Status | Size |
|---|-----|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | `STO-enmy-001` | _(name)_ | open | S/M/L |

## Design

### Approach

_(High-level technical approach. How will we solve the problem? Keep
to one or two paragraphs — details belong in story files.)_

### Architecture

_(Component sketch or short description of the key components touched.
For complex shapes, link to a diagram in the DESIGN.)_

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| _(Option A)_ | _(benefit)_ | _(drawback)_ | Rejected: _(reason)_ |
| _(Option B)_ | _(benefit)_ | _(drawback)_ | Selected |

## Decisions

| XID | Decision | Status | Rationale |
|-----|----------|--------|-----------|
| `HUG-enmy-NNN` | _(major architectural decision)_ | Adopted | _(why)_ |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| _(risk)_ | Medium | High | _(how to reduce)_ |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] _(How do we know we're done?)_
- [ ] _(Measurable outcome.)_
- [ ] All stories shipped.
- [ ] Tests passing.
- [ ] `docs/work-platform.md` (or other consumer-facing doc) updated.

## Milestones

## TUMU Provenance

- **Source:** docs/EPIC_quadruped_monster.md; docs/design/quadruped_monster.md (epic-specific design memo)
- **Shipped in:** v0.10.82
- **History:** A physics-based procedurally animated quadruped that hunts players across multi-platform levels using foot-driven locomotion, 2-bone IK, head tracking, eight attack types, and pre-cognition platform pathfinding. Rendered entirely via _draw() with a 23-point skeleton and runtime config stack. Core build shipped across v0.9.8-v0.9.17 and refined through the v0.10.x line; thrash/IK/damage polish stories remain open.
