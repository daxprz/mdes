solving it? One paragraph — this drives the rest of the epic.)_

## Goals

- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_
- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- _(Explicitly excluded.)_
- _(Future work — deferred to a later epic, ideally linked.)_

## Context

**Source:** _(Where did this come from? Prior epic, user request, bug
report, AID directive — name it explicitly.)_

**Dependencies:**

- _(What must be true before we can start?)_
- _(External systems or features we need.)_

### Approach

_(High-level technical approach. How will we solve the problem? Keep
to one or two paragraphs — details belong in story files.)_

### Architecture

_(Component sketch or short description of the key components touched.
For complex shapes, link to a diagram in the DESIGN.)_

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
