# Procedural Animation Roadmap

## Overview

_(One paragraph: what problem this design addresses; who benefits; what
is in scope. Definitional, not aspirational — the reader should walk
away knowing whether to read further.)_

## Background

_(Context: why this is needed now. What drove the decision to author
this design? Surface upstream prompts, prior failed attempts, or
strategic shifts that make this design's existence reasonable.)_

## Current State

_(Living section — what already exists in the codebase / system that
this design will extend or replace. Update as work lands.)_

## Goals

- _(Specific, testable outcome. Avoid "make X better" — say "X handles
  N concurrent operators without dropping events.")_
- _(Another goal. Each goal should map to at least one epic.)_

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- _(Explicitly excluded; what we are NOT solving here.)_
- _(Deferred to a future design — link if it exists.)_

## Epics

| XID | Epic | Status | Implements |
|-----|------|--------|------------|
| `EPI-mech-SLUG` | _(epic name)_ | open | _(HUG references)_ |

## Key Concepts

_(Optional: domain-specific terminology defined for the reader. Skip
if the system uses only standard CCC concepts — link to
`docs/work-platform.md` instead.)_

## TUMU Provenance

- **Source:** docs/design/animation_roadmap.md
- **Shipped in:** v0.10.10
- **History:** Cross-cutting roadmap for the quadruped monster's procedural animation: momentum and speed curves, attack wind-up and follow-through, and future wall climbing and wall jumping. Built atop the existing 2.5D projection, state machine, and cfg() systems.
