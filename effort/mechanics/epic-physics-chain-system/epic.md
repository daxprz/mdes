# Physics-Based Chain System

## Problem Statement

_(What problem are we solving? Why now? What's the impact of not
solving it? One paragraph — this drives the rest of the epic.)_

## Goals

- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_
- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- _(Explicitly excluded.)_
- _(Future work — deferred to a later epic, ideally linked.)_

## Context

**Source:** _(Where did this come from? Prior epic, user request, bug
report, AID directive — name it explicitly.)_

**Dependencies:**

- _(What must be true before we can start?)_
- _(External systems or features we need.)_

## Stories

| # | XID | Story | Status | Size |
|---|-----|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | `STO-mech-001` | _(name)_ | open | S/M/L |

## Design

### Approach

_(High-level technical approach. How will we solve the problem? Keep
to one or two paragraphs — details belong in story files.)_

### Architecture

_(Component sketch or short description of the key components touched.
For complex shapes, link to a diagram in the DESIGN.)_

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| _(Option A)_ | _(benefit)_ | _(drawback)_ | Rejected: _(reason)_ |
| _(Option B)_ | _(benefit)_ | _(drawback)_ | Selected |

## Decisions

| XID | Decision | Status | Rationale |
|-----|----------|--------|-----------|
| `HUG-mech-NNN` | _(major architectural decision)_ | Adopted | _(why)_ |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| _(risk)_ | Medium | High | _(how to reduce)_ |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] _(How do we know we're done?)_
- [ ] _(Measurable outcome.)_
- [ ] All stories shipped.
- [ ] Tests passing.
- [ ] `docs/work-platform.md` (or other consumer-facing doc) updated.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Actual | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Stories defined | | | open |
| Implementation complete | | | open |
| Tests passing | | | open |

## TUMU Provenance

- **Source:** docs/epics/EPIC_physics_chains.md
- **Shipped in:** v0.10.28
- **History:** A multi-body physics chain replacing the single-Node2D chain, with rigid links, joint rotation, selective collision (players pass through, world drapes), per-link damage and breakage, and rope parity via elastic joints. Shipped as FABRIK rigid-link chains across v0.9.19-v0.10.28, with creature attachment and breakaway sequences.
