## Problem Statement

_(What problem are we solving? Why now? What's the impact of not
solving it? One paragraph — this drives the rest of the epic.)_

## Goals

- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_
- _(Specific, measurable outcome.)_

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- _(Explicitly excluded.)_
- _(Future work — deferred to a later epic, ideally linked.)_

## Context

**Source:** _(Where did this come from? Prior epic, user request, bug
report, AID directive — name it explicitly.)_

**Dependencies:**

- _(What must be true before we can start?)_
- _(External systems or features we need.)_

## Design

### Approach

_(High-level technical approach. How will we solve the problem? Keep
to one or two paragraphs — details belong in story files.)_

### Architecture

_(Component sketch or short description of the key components touched.
For complex shapes, link to a diagram in the DESIGN.)_

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |

## TUMU Provenance

- **Source:** BACKLOG EPIC 19: Bug Fixes - Wave 2
- **Shipped in:** n/a
- **History:** Second wave focused on the profile and join flow: requiring profile selection before joining, persisting profiles to JSON in user://, and adding a ProfileManager autoload for device-profile mapping. Landed mid-March 2026 (commits 2026-03-14: persistent profiles saved to disk; players must always select profile on title screen).
